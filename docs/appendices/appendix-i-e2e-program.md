# End-to-End Test Program

## 1. Guiding Principle

Every functional and non-functional requirement must have at least one automated test that verifies its implementation.

!!! note "PR Gate"
    Every PR that implements or modifies a requirement must update the test matrix and link to a passing test.

!!! note "Release Gate"
    All P0 and P1 requirements must have passing tests before a release.

## 2. Test Categories

### 2.1 System E2E Core
These tests verify the basic functionality of the system as a whole and are run on every PR.

### 2.2 System E2E Advanced
These tests verify more complex scenarios and integrations but may take longer to run.

### 2.3 Resilience and Chaos
These tests verify the system's ability to handle failures and unexpected conditions.

### 2.4 DR and Backup/Restore
These tests verify the system's ability to recover from disasters and to backup and restore data.

### 2.5 SLO Validation
These tests verify that the system meets its service level objectives.

## 3. Test Scenarios

### 3.10 Observability Tests
* NFR-OBS-01: Verify complete instrumentation (metrics, logs, traces)

### 3.11 Configuration Tests
* NFR-CFG-01: Verify dynamic configuration updates

### 3.12 Resilience Tests
* NFR-RSL-01: Verify circuit breaker functionality
* NFR-RSL-02: Verify DLQ integration for all function blocks
* NFR-TEST-02: Verify chaos resilience

### 3.13 Security Tests
* NFR-SEC-01: Verify zero PII leakage
* NFR-SEC-02: Verify environment isolation

### 3.14 SLO Tests
* NFR-TEST-01: Verify SLO validation

## 4. Test Infrastructure

Tests are run in a Kubernetes environment that mirrors production as closely as possible.

## 5. Responsibility

Each team is responsible for maintaining the tests for the components they own.

## 6. Continuous Improvement

The test suite is continuously improved with new tests and better coverage.

## 7. Future-Proofing

The test matrix and program are designed to evolve with the product, ensuring that new requirements are properly tested.
