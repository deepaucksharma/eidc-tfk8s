# Test Status Updates

This document provides additional information about tests that are currently in development or in CI pipeline.

## In-CI Tests

### FR-DP-02: Stateful Detection
**Current Status**: In CI  
**Expected Completion**: 2025-05-15  
**Assignee**: J. Smith  
**Description**: Test is implemented and appears to be working correctly on local environments. Currently in CI pipeline for automated verification across all supported platforms.  
**Blockers**: None  
**Additional Notes**: Uses BadgerDB persistent storage to verify that deduplication state is maintained across pod restarts.

### FR-DLQ-02: Replay Capability
**Current Status**: In CI  
**Expected Completion**: 2025-05-17  
**Assignee**: A. Johnson  
**Description**: Implementation complete. Test verifies that messages sent to DLQ can be replayed back into the pipeline with correct headers and metadata.  
**Blockers**: None  
**Additional Notes**: Test needs to be coordinated with Kafka broker tests for full verification.

### NFR-TEST-02: Chaos Resilience
**Current Status**: In CI  
**Expected Completion**: 2025-05-20  
**Assignee**: S. Williams  
**Description**: Tests verify system resilience under various chaos conditions (network partitions, pod failures, resource exhaustion).  
**Blockers**: Some flakiness observed in resource exhaustion tests that needs to be addressed.  
**Additional Notes**: Currently running in reduced form in CI. Full tests will be enabled once stability issues are resolved.

## In-Development Tests

### FR-AGG-01: Metric Aggregation
**Current Status**: In Dev  
**Expected Completion**: 2025-05-25  
**Assignee**: R. Davis  
**Description**: Test verifies that metrics are properly aggregated over configured time windows.  
**Blockers**: Waiting on FB-AGG implementation enhancements to support configurable aggregation windows.  
**Additional Notes**: Currently implements basic aggregation tests, but more comprehensive tests are under development.

## Not Started Tests

### NFR-SEC-02: Isolated Environments
**Current Status**: Not Started  
**Expected Completion**: 2025-06-10  
**Assignee**: TBD  
**Description**: Will verify that development, testing, and staging environments are completely isolated.  
**Blockers**: Waiting on multi-environment configuration implementation.  
**Additional Notes**: Initial design documents in progress.

## Upcoming Test Improvements

1. **Enhanced Chaos Testing**: Adding more comprehensive network partition tests
2. **Performance Test Suite**: Adding detailed performance benchmarks
3. **Cross-Platform Validation**: Expanding test matrix to include additional Kubernetes distributions
4. **Security Scanning Integration**: Adding automated security scanning to the test pipeline
