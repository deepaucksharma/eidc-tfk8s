## Appendix I: End-to-End Test Program

## 1. Guiding Principle

Every functional and non-functional requirement must have at least one automated test that verifies its implementation.

!!! note "PR Gate"
    Every PR that implements or modifies a requirement must update the test matrix and link to a passing test.

!!! note "Release Gate"
    All P0 and P1 requirements must have passing tests before a release.

## 2. Test Categories

### 2.1 System E2E Core
These tests verify the basic functionality of the system as a whole and are run on every PR.

### 2.2 System E2E Advanced
These tests verify more complex scenarios and integrations but may take longer to run.

### 2.3 Resilience and Chaos
These tests verify the system's ability to handle failures and unexpected conditions.

### 2.4 DR and Backup/Restore
These tests verify the system's ability to recover from disasters and to backup and restore data.

### 2.5 SLO Validation
These tests verify that the system meets its service level objectives.

## 7. Future-Proofing

The test matrix and program are designed to evolve with the product, ensuring that new requirements are properly tested.
