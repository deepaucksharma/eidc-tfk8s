# NRDOT+ Internal Dev-Lab v2.1.2 Product Requirements Document v1.6

## Overview

NRDOT+ (New Relic Data Observability Telemetry Plus) Internal Dev-Lab v2.1.2 provides a sandbox environment for designing, deploying, and stress-testing Function-Block (FB) modules in realistic environments without affecting production systems.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-RX-01 — Data Ingestion
The system shall accept telemetry data in OTLP/gRPC, OTLP/HTTP, and Prometheus remote-write formats.

### FR-EN-01 — Host Enrichment
The system shall automatically enrich incoming data with host-level metadata.

### FR-EN-02 — Kubernetes Enrichment
The system shall automatically enrich incoming data with Kubernetes metadata when available.

### FR-CL-01 — Telemetry Classification
The system shall categorize and label incoming telemetry data.

### FR-DP-01 — Deduplication
The system shall identify and eliminate duplicate telemetry data.

### FR-DP-02 — Stateful Detection
The system shall maintain state necessary for detecting duplicates across restarts.

### FR-DP-03 — Optimized Storage
The system shall use BadgerDB for efficient deduplication data storage.

### FR-DP-04 — PII Hashing & Sanitization
The system shall detect, hash, and/or sanitize personally identifiable information.

### FR-FS-01 — Configurable Filtering
The system shall allow configuration of filtering rules based on pattern matching.

### FR-FS-02 — Sampling Control
The system shall support configurable sampling rates per data category.

### FR-AGG-01 — Metric Aggregation
The system shall provide aggregation capabilities for metrics.

### FR-GW-01 — Schema Enforcement
The system shall validate all outgoing data against a configurable schema.

### FR-GW-02 — Export Endpoints
The system shall support configurable export endpoints.

### FR-DLQ-01 — Dead Letter Processing
The system shall capture failed processing in a dead letter queue.

### FR-DLQ-02 — Replay Capability
The system shall support replaying messages from the dead letter queue.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-OPS-01 — Rapid Deployment
Function blocks must deploy or update in under 90 seconds with zero downtime.

### NFR-OBS-01 — Complete Instrumentation
All function blocks must expose Prometheus metrics, structured logs, and distributed traces.

### NFR-CFG-01 — Dynamic Configuration
All function blocks must accept configuration updates at runtime without restart.

### NFR-RSL-01 — Circuit Breaking
All function blocks must implement circuit breakers for downstream dependencies.

### NFR-RSL-02 — DLQ Integration
All function blocks must send failed processing to a dead letter queue.

### NFR-RSL-03 — Resource Limits
All function blocks must operate within defined resource constraints.

### NFR-SEC-01 — Zero PII Leakage
No personally identifiable information may be exposed through metrics or logs.

### NFR-SEC-02 — Isolated Environments
Development, testing, and staging environments must be completely isolated.

### NFR-TEST-01 — SLO Validation
System must include automated tests for service level objectives.

### NFR-TEST-02 — Chaos Resilience
System must include chaos tests for all critical components.
